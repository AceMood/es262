#五、符号规约
##5.1 语法和词法
###5.1.1 上下文无关的文法
上下文无关的文法由大量的成品组成。每个成品有一个抽象的符号叫做非终止符号在它的左边，另一边则是零个或多个非终止或终止符号组成。
每一种语法的终止符号都由指定的英文字母表示。

从一个由单个可识别的非终止字符组成的语句开始，叫做目标符号，一种上下文无关文法的语言，换句话说，（也许是无限的）可能的终止字符序列
的集合能够由：用右边的产出重复地替换序列中任何非终止字符产生。

###5.1.2 词法和正则文法
ES的词法在第七章给出。文法有其自己的终止符号(统一码单元)，遵守第六章描述的源码字符的规则。它定义了一个产出集合，从一个InputElementDiv
或者InputElementRegExp的目标符号开始，描述了这些字符序列是如何被翻译成输入元素序列的。


Input elements other than white space and comments form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for
ECMAScript and are called ECMAScript tokens. These tokens are the reserved words, identifiers, literals,
and punctuators of the ECMAScript language. Moreover, line terminators, although not considered to be tokens,
also become part of the stream of input elements and guide the process of automatic semicolon insertion (7.9).
Simple white space and single-line comments are discarded and do not appear in the stream of input elements for
the syntactic grammar. A MultiLineComment (that is, a comment of the form ―/*...*/‖ regardless of whether it spans
more than one line) is likewise simply discarded if it contains no line terminator; but if a MultiLineComment contains
one or more line terminators, then it is replaced by a single line terminator, which becomes part of the stream of input
elements for the syntactic grammar.


A RegExp grammar for ECMAScript is given in 15.10. This grammar also has as its terminal symbols the characters
as defined by SourceCharacter. It defines a set of productions, starting from the goal symbol Pattern, that describe
how sequences of characters are translated into regular expression patterns.


Productions of the lexical and RegExp grammars are distinguished by having two colons ―::‖ as separating punctuation.
The lexical and RegExp grammars share some productions.
